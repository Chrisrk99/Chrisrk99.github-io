  <p> <b>PART 1 : SKETCH PHASE </b>  </p> 


  <p>Here is my sketch for my magic mirror:</p> 
        
  <img  style="height: 600px; width:600px; margin-left:90px" src="SKETCH.png" >
  
  <ul>
   
   <li>On the top left on the screen we will have a weather midget with a max opacity to let the user see through it . </li> 
   <li>on the top right I plan to have the clock time with precise design , </li> 
   <li>On the bottom left we will have the news feed preview that will cycle.</li>  
   <li>on the mid-right side of the mirror , the user will have a personalized calender </li> 
   <li>On the bottom right, the user will have a cool BPM and weight feature. </li>
   <li>To finish the background is just an invert webcam to act exactly like a mirror</li>  
   <li>I decided to have my feature on the side of the screen to help the user see himself clearly</li>
   <li> all my feature are well align and share the same font</li>
   <li>I did my best to use the least amount of color and to group the widget by color</li>

  </ul>

<p><b> PART 2 : HOW MY MIRROR WORKS </b></p>

<ul>
   <p>Let's discuss the implementation</p>
  <li> First we have the weather widget. I used an api to get the actual weather for lubbock and what type of weather it is. The user will be able to see the city, temperature and type of weather </li> 
  <li> for the clock, I used 3 circle of different color, each color represent the hour, minutes and second. I implemented a drawing animation, for example the circle for the seconds will close and restart every 60 sec! The clock display the actual time</li> 
  <li> We also have the news feed. The user will be able to see a previews of the news and he can decided to click on the link if he wanted to learn more about. The news will be cycling and I used a JSON file to store the news and display it to the user</li>  
  <li> About the calendar this is pretty simple. The user will be able to see today's date and a list of things he has to do on this date. That's how I through of the personalized calendar. The list of things to do will come from a JSON File</li> 
  <li> Lastly, the BPM checker and weight. The user will be able to see his BPM on the screen with a heart animation that will go faster the more the bpm increase. Assuming the mirror has an movement detector! He will also be able to see his weight ! All those information will come from a JSON file</li> 
  <li></li>  
 </ul>

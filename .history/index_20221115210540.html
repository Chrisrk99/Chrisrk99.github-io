  <p> <b>PART 1 : SKETCH PHASE </b>  </p> 


  <p>Here is my sketch for my magic mirror:</p> 
        
  <img  style="height: 600px; width:600px; margin-left:90px" src="SKETCH.png" >
  
  <ul>
   
   <li>On the top left on the screen we will have a weather midget with a max opacity to let the user see through it . This weather will be made using the weather API</li> 
   <li>on the top right I plan to have the clock time with precise design , to help the user know exactly what's the time , will also add a cool animation</li> 
   <li>On the bottom left we will have the news feed  preview that will cycle. the user will have a link each time a news pop out , he can then decide to click on it to see or just look at the preview! the news will come form a JSON file</li>  
   <li>on the mid-right side of the mirror , the user will have a personalized calender with a list of things he has to do on the date that the calendar will display. The list will come from a JSON file</li> 
   <li>On the bottom right, the user will have a cool BPM feature. He would be able to see his heart beat in front of the mirror and his weight! Both BPM and weight will come from JSON file. </li>
   <li>To finish the background is just an invert webcam to act exactly like a mirror</li>  

  </ul>
